### Usage Description

1. **Select Dopants and Concentration**: In the `Dopants Selection` section, choose the desired dopants and their concentrations (at.%) for both A and B sites in the LCO structure. Supported dopants include:
    - A-site: Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd
    - B-site: Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Al, Ga

2. **Select System Conditions**: In the `System Conditions` section, specify the oxygen vacancy concentration (at.%) and the temperature (K) for the simulation. The temperature range is from 1000 K to 2500 K. The oxygen vacancy concentration ranges from 0 at.% to 5 at.%.

3. **Predict**: Click the `Predict` button to initiate the prediction process. The system will analyze the selected dopants and conditions, and provide predictions for the following properties:
    - Formation Energy (eV/atom)
    - Diffusion Coefficient (cm¬≤/s)
    - Lattice Distortion (%)
    - Atomic Distance (√Ö)

4. **Download Results**: After the prediction is complete, you can download the results in CSV format by clicking the `Download predicted data` button. The results will include the predicted properties for the selected dopants and conditions.

5. **Visualize Results**: The predicted results will be displayed in the `Predicted Data Visualization:` section, where you can visualize the predicted properties with interactive plots. The plots will show the relationship between the selected dopants, their concentrations, and the predicted properties.
